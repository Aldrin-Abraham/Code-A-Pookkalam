# Code a Pookkalam üéØ

## Basic Details
### Team Name: Kalki
### Team Members
- Team Lead: Aldrin Abraham - SSET

### Project Description
This project generates a vibrant digital Pookkalam (floral design) for Onam using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with SVG elements. It beautifully blends Kerala‚Äôs traditional festival art with modern web technologies.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
1. Languages Used:
* HTML (structure)
* CSS (styling, fonts, layout)
* JavaScript (dynamic SVG drawing)

2. Frameworks Used:
* None (pure vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS)

3. Libraries Used:
* Google Fonts (Baloo 2, Manjari for Malayalam & English text)

4. Tools Used:
* VS Code: For code editing and debugging.
* Git: Version control for managing changes and collaboration.
* GitHub: For hosting and managing the project repository.

### Project Documentation
* The SVG is dynamically created with JavaScript functions that calculate paths for circular and petal-like shapes.
* The annularSectorPath function is used to generate arc-based floral petal paths.
* Multiple concentric circles and petals are drawn with different radii and colors to give the layered floral look.
* A footer with author credit links directly to your GitHub profile.
* The design is responsive since it scales using viewBox and vmin units.

### Got Anything to share?
This project is inspired by Onam Pookkalam designs and brings cultural art into the digital space. It can be further extended with animations (rotating petals, glowing effects) or interactive features (hover color changes, click to add flowers).
